                This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance
                with the laws of (a) England if Licensee acquired the Services
                in a country in Europe, Africa or the Middle East, (b) Singapore
                if Licensee acquired the Services in a country in Asia, Oceania
                or the Asia-Pacific region, or (c) the State of California (and,
                to the extent controlling, the federal laws of the United
                States) if Licensee acquired the Services in a country in the
                Americas (including the Caribbean) or any other country not
                specified in this Section 9.2 (Governing Law and Jurisdiction).
                The laws of such jurisdictions shall govern without reference to
                the conflicts of-laws rules thereof. The UN Convention on
                Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform
                Computer Information Transaction Act shall not apply to (and are
                excluded from the laws governing) this Agreement. In addition,
                each party agrees that any claim, action or dispute arising
                under or relating to this Agreement will be brought exclusively
                in (and the parties will be subject to the exclusive
                jurisdiction of) the court in Puducherry, India except that if

                Africa or the Middle East, any such claim or dispute will be
                brought exclusively in (and the parties will be subject to the
                exclusive jurisdiction of) the courts of England, or (b) a
                country in Asia, Oceania or the Asia-Pacific region, any such
                claim or dispute will be brought exclusively in (and the parties
                will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of) the court of
                Puducherry, India. Nothing in the foregoing will prevent
                Prodotype from bringing an action for infringement of
                intellectual property rights in any country where such
                infringement is alleged to occur.

                assigns. Customer may not assign this Agreement or any of its
                rights or obligations hereunder to a third party without the
                prior written consent of Prodotype, which consent shall not be
                unreasonably withheld or delayed. Prodotype may assign or
                otherwise transfer its rights and obligations to its affiliates
                or successors-in-interest (whether by purchase of stock or
                assets, merger, operation of law, or otherwise) of that portion
                of its business related to the subject matter hereof. Prodotype
                may subcontract all or any portion of performance of the
                Services to one or more authorized third parties under the
                direction of Prodotype. <br />

                <br />
                No amendment, modification, or waiver of this Agreement shall be
                binding unless executed in writing by both parties. No waiver of
                any of the provisions of this Agreement shall constitute a
                waiver of any other provision (whether or not similar) or any
                subsequent breach or default, nor shall such waiver constitute a
                continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided. <br />
                <strong>15.0 Severability.</strong>
                <br />
                Any provision in this Agreement which is held to be illegal or
                unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall be ineffective to the
                extent of such illegality or unenforceability without
                invalidating the remaining provisions and any such illegal or
                unenforceable provision shall be deemed to be restated to
                reflect as nearly as possible the original intentions of the
                parties in accordance with applicable law.
                <br />
