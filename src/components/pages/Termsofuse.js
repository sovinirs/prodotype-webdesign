                  </strong>{' '}
                  The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”)
                  provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that
                  material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights
                  under Indian copyright law. If you believe in good faith that
                  materials available on the Site infringe your copyright, you
                  (or your agent) may send Prodotype a notice requesting that
                  Prodotype remove the material or block access to it. If you
                  believe in good faith that someone has wrongly filed a notice
                  of copyright infringement against you, the DMCA permits you to
                  send Prodotype a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices
                  must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by
                  the DMCA. See https://www.copyright.gov/ for details. Notices
                  and counter-notices should be addressed and sent to:
