                      This Consent for Linking (and Link-to-Prodotype Logo
                      Guidelines, if applicable) is the entire understanding
                      between the parties relating to the subject matter
                      referenced herein and supersedes all prior or
                      contemporaneous understandings, whether written or oral.
                      You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless
                      Prodotype, and its directors, officers, employees, agents,
                      shareholders, and representatives, from any claim, action,
                      allegation, damages, or liability (including attorney’s
                      fees) arising or relating to your breach of, or negligent
                      acts or omission relating to, your obligations under this
                      Consent for Linking. The foregoing indemnities shall
                      survive expiration or termination of this Consent for
                      Linking. You may not assign this Consent for Linking, in
                      whole or in part, without Prodotype’s prior written
                      permission. You shall have no power or authority to assume
                      or create any obligation or responsibility on behalf of
                      Prodotype nor may you hold yourself out, by implication or
                      otherwise, as holding such power or authority. This
                      Consent for Linking may only be modified, and a party may
                      only waive its rights under this Consent for Linking by a
                      written document executed by you and an authorized
                      signatory of Prodotype. Any failure to enforce any
                      provision of this Consent for Linking will not constitute
                      a waiver thereof or of any other provision hereof. In the
                      event any term of this Consent for Linking is found by any
                      court to be void or otherwise unenforceable, the remainder
                      of this Consent for Linking will remain valid and
                      enforceable as though such term were absent.
