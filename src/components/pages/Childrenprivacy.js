                  Prodotype websites, products and services (“applications”) are
                  primarily general interest applications designed for adults.
                  We do not knowingly collect personal data from children in
                  connection with those applications.
                  <br />
                  There are certain Prodotype applications that are appropriate
                  for and are intended for use by children. This Children's
                  Privacy Statement applies to these applications. Where there
                  is a conflict between this Children’s Privacy Statement and
                  other sections of our Privacy Statement, this Children’s
                  Privacy Statement sets the standard for how we treat
                  children’s personal information, consistent with the
                  requirements of the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection
                  Act and Rule (“COPPA”) and the European Union General Data
                  Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), where applicable.

                <p className='terms-text text-white text-justify mb-5'>
                  In the event we discover we have collected data from a child
                  in a manner inconsistent with COPPA’s requirements, we will
                  promptly either delete the data or seek parental or guardian
                  consent for that collection. For more information about COPPA
                  and general tips about protecting children’s online privacy,

                <p className='terms-text text-white text-justify mb-5'>
                  Where a website or application is appropriate for use by
                  children under 13 years old, children can register to (among
                  other things):
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>● view, interact with and download content</li>
                  <li>● take tutorials, create, edit, and import content</li>
                  <li>● like or follow other creators and their content</li>
                  <li>● comment on others’ content</li>

                  <li>● participate in contests</li>
                  <li>● view in-application notifications</li>
                </ul>
                <p className='terms-text text-white text-justify mb-5'>
                  During the registration process, we will ask the child to
                  provide certain personal data for security purposes and so we
                  can send notices to parents, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>● a parent or guardian’s email address</li>
                  <li>
                    ● the child’s name (only in the case of parent moderation)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    ● the child’s member or account username, and password
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p className='terms-text text-white text-justify mb-5'>
                  We also ask for birth dates from children to validate their
                  ages. Some activities, such as completing tutorials, do not
                  require children to provide any personal data and therefore
                  may not result in notice to the parent or guardian or require
                  parental or guardian consent. If a child chooses not to share
                  their personal data (i.e., a parent or guardian’s email for
                  purposes of consent) with us, this limits their access to
                  account creation and certain features, such as publishing
                  content publically. We will not require a child to provide
                  more data than is reasonably necessary in order to participate
                  in sections or features of the website or application. Also,
                  we will keep the data consistent with our retention practices.

                  Verifiable Parental Or Guardian Consent
                </h2>

                <p className='terms-text text-white text-justify mb-5'>
                  Depending on the website or application, we may seek different
                  types of parental or guardian consent. In each case, when we
                  ask for consent we will provide notice about the specific
                  activities available to a child through the website or
                  application.
                  <br />
                  Parental or guardian consent
                  <br />
                  Because our websites and applications include activities that
                  allow children to create, share and publically post content,
                  to utilize certain features and functionality, we seek further
                  parental or guardian consent:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    ● by asking for a credit card or other payment method for
                    verification (with a nominal charge involved), or
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    ● by requiring a signed consent form by mail or email
                    attachment.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p className='terms-text text-white text-justify mb-5'>
                  We also require parents or guardians to open their own account
                  so that they can view and moderate their child’s account. For
                  further details, please see Parental Choices and Controls
                  below.
                  <br />
                  After providing further parental consent, we may offer parents
                  the opportunity to use a password in future communications as
                  a way to confirm the parent’s identity.
                  <br />
                  Teacher consent in lieu of a parent
                  <br />
                  For school-based activities, COPPA allows teachers and school
                  administrators to act in the place of parents to provide
                  consent for the collection of personal data from children.
                  Schools should always notify parents about these activities.
                  In some cases, in order that an account is not closed and so
                  that a child can continue to use a website or application
                  outside of the school context, we may ask schools to obtain
                  consent directly from a parent instead of and/or in addition
                  to providing consent in the place of a parent, so the parent
                  can be added as a moderator.

                  <strong>Content Generated by a Child</strong>
                  <br />
                  Our applications include activities that allow children to
                  create or manipulate content and save it. We honor requests to
                  delete any content that they post on our websites and
                  applications, unless we are required by law to retain it.
                  <br />
                  <strong>Forums and comments</strong>
                  <br />
                  Certain activities allow users to communicate directly with
                  other users by means of user forums or comments sections. We
                  strongly encourage children who use these interactive features
                  on our websites and in our applications never to provide
                  personal data about themselves or any third-party, and not to
                  attempt to circumvent any moderation features.
                  <br />
                  <strong>Contests</strong>
                  <br />
                  In all of our contests for children, we will require only the
                  data necessary to enter the contest, such as user name and
                  parent email address (to notify the parent where required by
                  law). We only contact the parent for more personalized data
                  for prize-fulfillment purposes if the child wins the contest.
                  <br />
                  <strong>Email Contact with a Child</strong>
                  <br />
                  In some of our applications, we may collect online contact
                  information, such as an email address, in order to communicate
                  with a child who makes a specific request through customer
                  service. For example, a child may email us to ask for help in
                  understanding how to use a design tool if she or he is having
                  trouble with. Or the child may want to sign up for a monthly
                  newsletter.
                  <br />
                  If we have actual knowledge that we are communicating with a
                  child under the age of 13 without parental consent, we will
                  respond once to the communication, delete their personal
                  information, and will not participate in any ongoing
                  communication.
                  <br />
                </p>
                <p className='terms-text text-white text-justify mb-5'>
                  Here is how we would handle communication requests:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>● One-time communication</li>
                  <li>
                    ● After we respond to the child’s question or request, we or
                    our service provider will delete this data immediately after
                    responding to the question or request.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    ● If a child initiates additional communication, submits
                    additional tickets, or signs up for newsletters, we will
                    delete the child’s personal data in each instance, and will
                    not retain a record. The parent may need to opt-out of each
                    communication separately.
                  </li>
                  <li>● Communicating more than once</li>
                  <li>
                    ● Where there is an activity or service where we need to
                    communicate with a child more than once and we have not
                    already obtained parental consent:
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    ● If we collect the child’s contact data for ongoing
                    communications, we will also require a parent’s email
                    address (if we have not already obtained verifiable parental
                    consent) so we can notify the parent about the collection
                    and use, and to provide the parent with an opportunity to
                    prevent further contact with the child.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <strong>Persistent Identifiers</strong>

                <p className='terms-text text-white text-justify mb-5'>
                  When children interact with us, certain data may be collected
                  automatically, both to make our websites and applications more
                  interesting and useful to children and for various purposes
                  related to our business.
                  <br />
                  Examples include:
                </p>

                  <li>● the type of computer operating system</li>
                  <li>● the child’s IP address or mobile device identifier</li>
                  <li>● the web browser used</li>
                  <li>

                  Please note that teachers only have these rights if they are

                  Where a child under 13 has registered for an account, we use
                  two methods to allow parents/teachers to access, change, or
                  delete the personal data that we have collected from their
                  children:
                  <br />

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    ● moderators can request access to and delete their child’s
                    personal data by logging into the parent’s moderator account
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    ● moderators can contact us to request access, a change, or
                    delete their child’s personal data by sending an email to us
                    at contact@prodotype.in
